# Sales_Trend_Analysis_using_SQL

Analysis of a sales dataset named "Sales Shop 2025" collected from Kaggle.

The data has been grouped and ordered on the basis of month and year.

Month and Year have been extracted from the order date using the EXTRACT() command. 

Total revenue and Total no. of orders have also been computed using the SUM() and COUNT() commands.

I have also limited the output to give the total revenue and total no.of orders between two dates using the WHERE() command.

Screenshots of the output and the SQL command script has been attached.
